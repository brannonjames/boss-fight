# BOSSFIGHT

My first time really playing with react and redux, BossFight is a 
simple virtual card game where you battle different "bosses". 

All bosses are pulled from [r/Bossfight](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bossfight/)

## How to play

Clone and cd into repo

Run `npm install` to add dependencies

Run `npm start` to play!


## Instructions

Your stage will automatically fill with random Boss Cards. Selected a Boss you want to battle with and click the battle button. 
The computer will automatically choose a Boss and both will battle in the Arena.
The last player with Boss Cards is the winner.


Currently working on a more strategic gameplay.
